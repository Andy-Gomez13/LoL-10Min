# LoL-10Min

I tackled a data set in this repository that touches on the overall win rate for a very popular game, League of Legends.  In this project, you will discover my analysis and graphical representation of predicting victories in the game's first 10 minutes. This data includes various variables that help determine the best model to help predict wins in the "Blue" side of the game. 

Additionally, you will find the code I used to clean the data as well as how I prepared the data for different types of analysis. I ran different visual graphs (histogram, boxplots) to demonstrate some aspects of the data. I also used different machine learning techniques to try to determine which method (KNN, Regression, Random Forest) would provide a better prediction model.

Below are a couple of the graphs I used to help display the data along with a short video presentation of my findings.
